//! # network-internet-control-message-protocol
//!
//! A domain model of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets and associated types.
//!
//! This crate has the optional feature `dpdk-sys`, which adds support for converting Into and From DPDK representations.
//!
//! It has an experimental feature `libc`, which does not compile as of libc 0.2.42 (libc is missing essential definitions).
