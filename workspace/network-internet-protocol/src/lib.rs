//! # network-internet-protocol
//!
//! A domain model of internet protocol version 4 and version 6 host addresses, masks, network addresses and packets and associated types.
//!
//! This crate has the optional feature `dpdk-sys`, which adds support for converting Into and From DPDK representations.
//!
//! This crate also has the default features:-
//!
//! * `drop-packets-with-ipv4-options`: Drops internet protocol (IP) version 4 packets with IP options. Violates RFC 791 but IP options are very rarely used, the few that are used have potential to be used as attack vectors and none have any meaning to this library.
//! * `drop-ipv4-packets-with-do-not-fragment-and-non-zero-identification`: Drops internet protocol (IP) version 4 packets with the Do Not Fragment (DF) flag set and a non-zero (fragment) identification. Violates RFC 6864 Section 4.1 paragraph 5 but there is no good reason to send IP packets with DF set and a non-zero (fragment) identification. In particular, the identification field in these cases can be used as a covert channel and to infer the number of devices behind a NAT proxy.
//! * `drop-ipv6-packets-with-non-zero-flow-label`: Drop internet protocol (IP) version 6 packets whose flow label is not zero. There is no good reason to be receiving such packets for ICMP, TCP and UDP flows.
//! * `drop-ipv6-fragments-when-first-reserved-field-is-not-zero`: Drop internet protocol (IP) version 6 packets whose fragment extension header has a non-zero first reserved field (8-bits). Violates RFC 8200 Section 4.5 but there is no good reason to be receiving such packets.
//! * `drop-ipv6-fragments-when-second-reserved-field-is-not-zero`: Drop internet protocol (IP) version 6 packets whose fragment extension header has a non-zero second reserved field (2-bits). Violates RFC 8200 Section 4.5 but there is no good reason to be receiving such packets.
//! * `drop-overly-small-ipv6-fragments-aggresively`: We always drop fragments smaller than they need to be (444 byte MSS). This setting drops fragments (except the last) smaller than that possible using a 1280 byte MSS. Violates RFC 8200 Section 4.5 but there is no good reason to be receiving such packets.
